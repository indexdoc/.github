# IndexDoc Open Source Toolkit

IndexDoc is a collection of open-source tools for office and development scenarios, focusing on three core values: 「Efficiency Improvement, Process Simplification, and Privacy Security」. It covers five high-frequency scenarios: batch document generation, standardized code generation, local document AI interaction, legal document assistance, and Markdown editing, helping individuals and teams eliminate repetitive work and improve work and development efficiency.

This open-source project includes the following core modules, which can be used independently or combined to adapt to various scenarios:

## 1. indexdoc-batch-generator (Batch Document Assistant)

A template-driven efficient batch document generation tool, specifically designed to solve the pain points of 「repetitive document editing and inconsistent formatting」. With one click, you can batch generate standardized professional documents, completely getting rid of tedious copy-paste work.

### Core Advantages

- **High Efficiency & Convenience**: Automatically completes the entire document generation process without manual editing and replacement, greatly shortening the document production cycle and significantly improving work efficiency;

- **Eliminate Repetition**: Get rid of the tedious operation of repeatedly editing similar documents, focus energy on polishing core content, and save a lot of time costs;

- **Accuracy & Error-Free**: Unified templates and replacement rules avoid human errors such as formatting chaos and content omissions caused by manual editing, ensuring document consistency;

- **Flexible Adaptation**: Widely supports various document types such as legal documents, business contracts, daily reports, and office notices, adapting to office needs of multiple industries.

### Core Features

Supports uploading Excel data files and Word template files. You can define the file name rules of the final generated documents and all fields to be replaced in the Word template through the Excel file; in the Word template, you only need to mark the content to be replaced in the form of 「{column name}」 (the column name is exactly the same as the corresponding column in the Excel file). After completing simple configurations and clicking the generate button, you can quickly batch generate all documents that meet the requirements, greatly reducing the time cost of manual editing.

## 2. indexdoc-model-to-code (Code Generator / CodeAsst)

CodeAsst (Code Assistant) is an efficient code generation tool for development teams and individuals. It follows the core design concept of 「Data Model + Template = Code」, aiming to realize batch code generation and standardized output, reduce repetitive coding work, and improve development efficiency and code quality.

### Core Features

- **Multi-Data Source Adaptation**: Supports importing PDM files generated by PowerDesigner, can obtain table models from various mainstream databases such as Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, and also supports manually editing and defining data models through XML files;

- **Flexible Template Syntax**: Adopts Velocity-like syntax (compatible with Freemarker), reducing learning costs and supporting custom template sets;

- **Batch & Efficient Generation**: A template set can contain multiple template files, and with one click, you can generate all code files and configuration files of a complete software project without writing them one by one;

- **Widely Applicable**: Suitable for various software companies, development studios, R&D teams and individual developers, especially for the development mode of 「designing data models first, then writing code」.

### Tool Value

Data models are the foundation of software systems, and most system operations revolve around the addition, deletion, modification and query of basic data. After proficiently using CodeAsst, you can batch generate almost all basic codes of a system; furthermore, you can quickly batch generate Demo versions of multiple systems based on the code templates of existing systems, helping developers quickly launch projects and reduce development costs — this is not an exaggeration, but the core capability that CodeAsst has realized.

## 3. indexdoc-ai-offline (Local Document AI Assistant)

A lightweight, efficient, and privacy-first local document AI interaction tool, presented in the form of a client. It focuses on solving the needs of 「accurate Q&A and key information extraction for local documents」. You can realize intelligent interaction between humans and documents without uploading documents to third-party platforms, balancing efficiency and privacy security.

### Core Advantages

- **Natural Interaction**: No tedious operations are required; you can quickly obtain relevant information by asking questions to the document in daily conversation, and it is easy to get started;

- **Accurate Q&A**: Equipped with powerful semantic understanding and content analysis capabilities, it can accurately identify user's question intentions, and accurately extract key information, interpret details, and summarize core content from documents;

- **In-Depth Analysis**: Supports information extraction and in-depth content mining of complex documents, can quickly sort out document logic, extract core viewpoints, and save time in document reading and sorting;

- **Privacy & Security**: Files are stored and parsed locally throughout the process, without being uploaded to any third-party servers, effectively protecting document privacy and data security;

- **Knowledge Management**: Can structurally organize document knowledge, helping individuals and enterprises build exclusive knowledge sharing platforms and improve knowledge reuse efficiency.

### Core Features

Supports uploading various common document formats such as PDF, TXT, and DOCX, and can batch upload multiple files; after uploading, you can freely select a single file or folder, and the AI will only respond based on the content of the selected files, avoiding interference from irrelevant information and improving Q&A accuracy; it supports asking personalized questions for selected files, quickly responding to interpretation needs, and also supports saving Q&A history for subsequent review and reference. With a concise interface and no complex configuration, it focuses on core functions and meets various local document interaction scenarios.

## 4. indexdoc-legal-assistant (Legal Document Assistant)

A document assistance tool specially designed for legal practitioners, simplifying the judgment document production process, improving document generation efficiency and standardization, and adapting to daily office needs of legal scenarios such as courts and law firms.

### Core Process

Upload 「Indictment」 and 「Court Record」 (supports common file formats such as PDF and DOCX, and provides sample files for quick reference) → The tool automatically generates a preliminary judgment document → Supports manual editing and modification of the generated document content → Preview the document effect and export the final version. The entire process simplifies operations and reduces the workload of manual writing.

## 5. indexdoc-editor (Markdown Editor)

A lightweight, concise Markdown editing tool suitable for developers and office workers, focusing on the core needs of 「efficient editing, convenient preview, and standardized formatting」. It supports full Markdown syntax and adapts to various Markdown document editing scenarios (such as project documents, notes, README, etc.). It will continue to be iterated and optimized in the future, adding more practical functions (such as format export, shortcut key customization, etc.), helping users quickly edit high-quality Markdown documents.

## Future Plans

This project will continue to be iterated and optimized, constantly improving the functions of each module, fixing known issues, and adding more practical functions adapted to office and development scenarios based on user feedback, striving to build a more comprehensive, efficient, and easy-to-use open-source toolset.

Welcome all developers to Star and Fork this project, participate in code contribution, and put forward valuable suggestions to improve the IndexDoc series of tools together!
